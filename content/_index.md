Hi, I’m Oussama! 👋


I am currently a visiting student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) working with Professors [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [Loubna Benabbou](https://www.uqar.ca/universite/a-propos-de-l-uqar/departements/unites-departementales-des-sciences-de-la-gestion/benabbou-lobna) on Machine Learning Applied to Physics. Prior to this, I obtained my engineering degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (2021) and a Msc. in ["Mathematics, Vision & Learning"](https://www.master-mva.com/) (2021) from ENS Paris-Saclay (commonly known as MVA). 

I am interested in discovering physical laws and processes in a data-driven way. I am also interested in finding physically informed algorithms for scientific applications such as material discovery.
